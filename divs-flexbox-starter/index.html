                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <p>I have loved coding as far back as I can remember. From the moment I received my first computer, I was interested in all things tech, how it worked, etc. Once the internet became apart of my day to day life, I was even more hooked. I even attempted basic hacking skills as early as age 11.</p>

                <h1>Fitness</h1>
                <p>Yes, I am one of those people who LOVES exercising and working out. It has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my life, not just physically. Weight lifting is my favorite method of exercising but recently I've added more yoga. Sure nice to stretch and relax after working hard and lifting heavy.

                <h1>Travel</h1>
                <p>The travel bug has bitten. Been fortunate to have been to some great cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The next destination? All over Europe, starting with seeing as much of Spain as possible. I think I might start with a one way airline ticket and go as far as I can go!
